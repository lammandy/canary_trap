# Canary Trap

Canary Trap was created to catch the mole that's been leaking secrets from your company. Canary Trap has two functions. 
First, it creates multiple unique texts with slight differences based on an ID number. 
Second, once you've found the leaked document, you can save it as a .txt file to match this unique document to the one that was created previously to find your mole!
