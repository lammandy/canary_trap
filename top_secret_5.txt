To whom this may concern, 
  
The CIA had captured terrorism suspects in the decade before September 11. Suspects were usually held in CIA custody for a short time before being transferred to their home countries, where they were usually wanted on criminal charges — most commonly Egypt. Before September 11, each “rendition” required high-level approval of the decision to capture and transfer specific, named individuals. CIA officials maintained that the purpose was to get suspects off the street, not to interrogate them, although many were interrogated under torture. 

Bush’s September 17 memorandum of notification removed these limits and gave lower level CIA officials “significant discretion in determining whom to detain, the factual basis for the detention, and the length of the detention,” in the words of a Senate Intelligence Committee report. The CIA captured more people, based on less evidence, and rendered them to foreign countries including Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Libya for interrogation and torture.

But in March 2002, the U.S. government captured a suspect whose interrogation it considered too important to outsource. On March 28, 2002, U.S. and Pakistani forces captured over 30 suspects in a series of raids in Faisalabad, Pakistan. One of the suspects was a Palestinian man named Abu Zubaydah, whom the CIA mistakenly believed was a high ranking al-Qaida member.
